WIP  
  
This app will display the current weekly schedule for all NBA teams in a grid (table), much like HashtagBasketball does. The teams will be displayed in the rows and the the days of the week in the columns. If a team has a game on one of the days, the intersecting cell will show their opponent. 
  
  
The features that I will add are:  
- integration with fantasy basketball team (starting with ESPN)  
- filter the teams based on the games that you want to add games (dropping players and adding FA)
- display your team's roster, with a similar schedule displayed for each player (maybe sort by team instead of starters/bench by position?)
- among the filtered teams, display players that are available (not on rosters)
- if they are available, display whether they are FA or W (on waivers)
- if W, display the day when waivers clear for them
- not sure how to display these players yet (maybe on hovering over team row or toggle on/off in a separate area on the page)
  
  
The goal of this app is to help visualize the games played in the week and ultimately maximize the number of games played. 


More features that will be added down the line:  
- give each player on your roster a value (maybe based on stats/projections/draft position?) 
- do the same for FA/W players  
- set a "plan" to drop players and pick up FAs
- based on the plan, run through your roster's schedule for the week with updated players that you
